Modeling excersice for the Computational Visual Neuroscience seminar HS21:

`Generate yourself some data from a simple 
(polynomial) model with noise. Then write a program in R, Python or 
MATLAB to do the three essential modeling steps: optimisation, goodness-of-
fit and estimating variability (using the correct, generative model).`

This application will thus:

- Generate a data set using a polynomial function and a random offset on each data point
- Define a model the data set is being compared against
- Find the model's best parameters to describe the data set
- Calculate goodness-of-fit
- Estimate variability
